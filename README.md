# TOM-Server-Python

A Python implementation of the server that handles the client data and application logic
- A backend server to handle data processing and running of various services. 
- It takes input from a variety of sources, including video streams and the WebSocket Server. 
- Designed to be easy for developers to implement new services and to be able to support real-time data processing.


## Requirements

- Make sure `python3` is installed


## Installation

- Install `conda` ([Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)). Note that some packages may not work with Anaconda.
  - Upgrade pip, using `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel`
- Create new conda environment `tom` using `conda env create -f environment-cpu.yml`
  - If you have a previous environment, then update it, `conda env update --file environment-cpu.yml --prune`. 
  - To completely remove previous env run, `conda remove -n tom --all`, then recreate the environment.
  - For ARM Mac (M1-Mn chip), 
    - If the installation fails due to `pyaudio`, please follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33513522/when-installing-pyaudio-pip-cannot-find-portaudio-h-in-usr-local-include)
    - If the installation fails due to `egg_info`, change the dependency `psycopg2` to `psycopg2-binary` in `environment-cpu.yml`
    - If the installation fails due to `googlemaps`, either remove it from `environment-cpu.yml` or install it separately using `pip install --use-pep517 googlemaps` after activating the `tom` environment.
- Activate `tom` environment, `conda activate tom`
- Download the pretrained weights for YOLOv8 from [Ultralytics](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) (e.g., [yolov8n.pt](https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt)).
  - Copy the downloaded file to the `Processors/Yolov8/weights` directory and rename it as `model.pt` (i.e., `Processors/Yolov8/weights/model.pt`).
- Create the environment files:
  - **For development environment:** Copy `.sample_env` to `.env.dev` and [optional] update the values if needed.
    - e.g., `CAMERA_VIDEO_SOURCE = 0` uses the default camera and can be changed to any video stream/URL/file source.
      - [Optional] To use the HoloLens camera, uncomment the following lines in [main.py](main.py) and update the IP address in `credential/hololens_credential.json`:
        ```python
        # from APIs.hololens import hololens_portal
        # hololens_portal.set_api_credentials()
        # hololens_portal.set_hololens_as_camera()
        ```
  - **For testing environment:** Copy `.sample_env` to `.env.test` and [optional] update the values if needed.
- [Optional] Create the required credential files inside the newly created `credential` folder, **ONLY** for third-party libraries you use. Please refer to the [Third-party libraries](#Third-party-libraries) section to obtain credentials. *(Note: JSON format must be correct.)*
  - Create a file `credential/hololens_credential.json` with Hololens credentials such as `{"ip": "IP","username": "USERNAME","password": "PASSWORD"}`
    - [Configure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/advanced-concepts/using-the-windows-device-portal#connecting-over-wi-fi) the Hololens Device Portal. Save [your credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/develop/platform-capabilities-and-apis/using-the-windows-device-portal#creating-a-username-and-password) to `credential/hololens_credential.json`
  - Create a file `credential/google_cloud_credentials.json` with [Google Cloud API](https://cloud.google.com/apis) credentials.
    - Follow [authentication](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/hackathon-toolkit/blob/master/vision/README.md#authentication) to get json key file and rename it to `google_cloud_credentials.json`
  - Create a file `credential/openai_credential.json` with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) credentials such as `{"openai_api_key": "KEY"}`
  - Create a file `credential/gemini_credential.json` with [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/) credentials such as `{"gemini_api_key": "KEY"}`
  - Create a file `credential/anthropic_credential.json` with [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/api) credentials such as `{"anthropic_api_key": "KEY"}`
  - Create a file `credential/google_maps_credential.json` with Google Maps credentials such as `{"map_api_key": "KEY"}`
    - Current Google Maps APIs used:
      - [Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)
      - [Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/overview)
      - [Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/maps-static/overview)
    - To use Google Maps API, you need to have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account to get an API key and enable the APIs shown above.
  - Create a file `credential/ors_credential.json` with [Openrouteservice](https://openrouteservice.org/) credentials such as `{"map_api_key": "KEY"}`
  - Create a file `credential/geoapify_credential.json` with [Geoapify](https://www.geoapify.com/) credentials such as `{"map_api_key": "KEY"}`
  - Create a file `credential/fitbit_credential.json` with Fitbit credentials such as `{"client_id": "ID","client_secret": "SECRET"}`
- [Optional] If you want to simulate running assistance on a treadmill, follow the steps in [Running Demo Service](#configuring-first-person-video-for-running-service)
- [Optional] To use `APIs/local_yyy` (e.g., [local_vector_db](APIs/local_vector_db/README.md)), please follow the `README.md` inside those local APIs.
  - Note: Certain services (e.g., [memory_assistance_service](Services/memory_assistance_service)) depends on those local APIs.


## Setup the clients

- Makesure the clients (e.g., HoloLens, Xreal, WearOS Watch) are connected to the same Wi-Fi network of the Sever. Use a **private** network, as public networks may block certain ports used by websocket communication (e.g., 8090). Note: Campus network may not work.
- Use `ipconfig` / `ifconfig` in your terminal to get the Server IP address. Look for the IPv4 address under the Wi-Fi section.

#### TOM-MRTK-Unity (Meta Quest)

- Set up [TOM-MRTK-Unity](https://github.com/TOM-Platform/TOM-MRTK-Unity/tree/dev/meta_quest) for Meta Quest and make sure to update the IP address in  address is set correctly in  `ConfigData.cs`. (refer to Client Code README.md for details)


#### Other Clients (TOM-Client-Unity / WearOS / Web)

- Set up [TOM-Client-Unity](https://github.com/TOM-Platform/TOM-Client-Unity) on the HoloLens/Xreal and make sure to update the IP address in `Videos/TOM/tom_config.json`.
- [Optional] Set up [TOM-Client-WearOS](https://github.com/TOM-Platform/TOM-Client-WearOS) on the Android smartwatch and make sure to update the IP address in `app/src/main/java/com/hci/tom/android/network/Credentials.kt`.
- [Optional] Set up [TOM-Client-Web](https://github.com/TOM-Platform/TOM-Client-Web) on a computer and make sure to update the IP address in `src/constant/config.ts`.
- [Troubleshooting] If clients cannot connect to the server via websocket, try the following steps:
  - Ensure that all clients are on the same network as the server. For devices running Windows OS, such as PCs or HoloLens, set the network connection to **private**.
  - Check the firewall settings on the server machine and allow the server application to communicate through the firewall.
  - To test if the server is reachable, use another computer on the same network to run [WebSocketClientTester.html](Tests/WebSocketClientTester.html). This test will attempt to open port 8090 on the server, confirming if it's accessible from another device.


## Application execution

1. Use the `tom` environment:
   - Activate it via the command line: `conda activate tom` (for Conda users) or through your IDE.
2. Export the environment variable `ENV`:
   - For Windows Command Prompt:
     ```cmd
     set ENV=dev
     ```
   - For Windows PowerShell:
     ```powershell
     $env:ENV = "dev"
     ```
   - For Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     export ENV=dev
     ```
3. Run the application:
   - Execute `main.py` using:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
     *(Avoid using `py main.py`.)*
4. [Optional] Configure your IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) to run the server with the environment variable `ENV=dev`.
5. [Optional] Run the clients after the server has started.
