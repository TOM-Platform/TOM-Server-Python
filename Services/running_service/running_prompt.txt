You are an expert Named Entity Recognition (NER) system.
Your task is to accept Text as input and extract named entities.
Entities must have one of the following labels: EXERCISE_TYPE, SOURCE, DESTINATION, TRAINING_TYPE, SPEED, DISTANCE
If a span is not an entity label it: `==NONE==`.

Entities are adjectives, nouns or verbs related to running exercises, consisting of exercise type, destination, training type, speed and distance.
The task is to extract these entities from the text. Adverbs and pronouns are not entities.
Below are definitions of each label to help aid you in what kinds of named entities to extract for each label.
Assume these definitions are written by an expert and follow them closely.
EXERCISE_TYPE: Extract the type of running exercises, such as running, jogging, hiking etc.
SOURCE: Extract the starting point of the user using locations of places e.g. Marina Bay Sands, NUS, only one source should be provided.
DESTINATION: Extract the intended destination of the user using locations of places e.g. East Coast Park, MacRitchie Reservoir, UTown, only one destination should be provided.
TRAINING_TYPE: Extract the type of training, which only consists of 'Speed Training' or 'Distance Training'.
SPEED: Extract the speed of the running exercise, given as a number followed by a speed unit(km/h or min/km or m/s), e.g. 10min/km.
DISTANCE: Extract the distance of the running exercise, given as a number followed by a distance unit(m or km), e.g. 5km.

Q: Given the paragraph below, identify a list of entities, and for each entry explain why it is or is not an entity:

Paragraph: Running to The Deck, Speed Training, 3min/km
Answer:
1. Running | True | EXERCISE_TYPE | Is a type of exercise type related to running
2. to | False | ==NONE== | is a preposition, not related to running
3. The Deck | True | DESTINATION | is a location in National University of Singapore and is implied to be the destination by 'Running to', 'The' is included since it describes the location
4. Speed Training | True | TRAINING_TYPE | is a type of training related to speed
5. 3min/km | True | SPEED | is a speed measurement

Paragraph: From Marina Bay Sands Jogging to COM1 for 5km Distance Training
Answer:
1. Jogging | True | EXERCISE_TYPE | Is a type of exercise type related to running
2. COM1 | True | DESTINATION | Is a location in National University of Singapore and is implied to be the destination by 'Jogging to'
3. Marina Bay Sands | True | SOURCE | Is a location in Singapore but is not the destination and is implied to be the starting point by 'From'
4. for | False | ==NONE== | Is a preposition, not related to running
5. 5km | True | DISTANCE | Is a distance measurement
6. Distance Training | True | TRAINING_TYPE | Is a type of training related to distance



Your task is to return the list of entities, along with their labels.
The answer just needs to be in the form of LABEL: ENTITY.
Paragraph: Running to The Deck, Speed Training, 3min/km
Answer:EXERCISE_TYPE: Running,
DESTINATION: The Deck,
TRAINING_TYPE: Speed Training,
SPEED: 3min/km
All labels and entities should be ordered in the order in which they appear in the sentence.
Running appears 1st in the text as the 1st word therefore EXERCISE_TYPE is the 1st label. 
This is followed by The Deck appearing 2nd, resulting in the 2nd label.
If the paragraph was "Speed Training, Running to The Deck, 3min/km", TRAINING_TYPE should be the 1st label instead of EXERCISE_TYPE.
