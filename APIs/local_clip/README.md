## Local CLIP

- This will be a local version of the CLIP model that can be used for inference based on [Hugging Face, Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/clip) 
- When executing for the first time, it will download the model (defined in `_CLIP_VERSION`) from the Hugging Face model hub and cache it locally.
